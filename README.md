## MY Build of Suckless DWM
  This is pretty much stock DWM with a few tweaks applied best to suit my workflow.
### Patches added
  The only patch I added so far is single tagset since I run multiple monitors.
### Other Tewaks:
  I changed the original number of tags from 9 to 2, one per each monitor i'm currently running.
